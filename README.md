## OS X Setup

Make sure you have [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed and up-to-date,
then open up a terminal and run:
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

Once your environment has been provisioned, you should be able to
access the PHP info page at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

By default the MySQL username is **root** and the password is **admin**.
